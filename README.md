---This is a **minimal working RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)** demo using:



## 🆕 15 New Food Items Added- ✅ Local LLM via [Ollama](https://ollama.com/)

- ✅ Local embeddings via `mxbai-embed-large`

### 🇵🇱 Cultural/Regional Cuisine (Polish Heritage)- ✅ [ChromaDB](https://www.trychroma.com/) as the vector database

1. **Borscht** - Traditional beetroot soup with deep cultural significance, rich in folate and vitamin C- ✅ A simple food dataset in JSON (Indian foods, fruits, etc.)

2. **Pierogies** - Classic Polish dumplings with various fillings, representing family traditions

3. **Golumpki** - Stuffed cabbage rolls, a Sunday dinner staple with balanced nutrition---

4. **Kielbasa** - Traditional smoked Polish sausage, high in protein with distinctive flavor

5. **Sernik** - Polish cheesecake made with twaróg, an Easter celebration dessert## 🎯 What This Does



### 🥗 Healthy Superfood OptionsThis app allows you to ask questions like:

6. **Quinoa Buddha Bowl** - Complete protein superfood bowl with colorful vegetables and healthy fats

7. **Açaí Bowl** - Brazilian antioxidant-rich breakfast with anti-inflammatory benefits- “Which Indian dish uses chickpeas?”

8. **Chia Pudding** - Ancient superfood providing omega-3s, fiber, and sustained energy- “What dessert is made from milk and soaked in syrup?”

9. **Kale and Sweet Potato Salad** - Vitamin-packed modern salad with farm-to-table philosophy- “What is masala dosa made of?”

10. **Green Smoothie Bowl** - Nutrient-dense breakfast supporting detoxification and immune function

It **does not rely on the LLM’s built-in memory**. Instead, it:

### 🌍 International Culinary Classics

11. **Paella** - Spain's iconic rice dish from Valencia with saffron and socarrat technique1. **Embeds your custom text data** (about food) using `mxbai-embed-large`

12. **Coq au Vin** - French braised chicken showcasing wine-based cooking mastery2. Stores those embeddings in **ChromaDB**

13. **Thai Green Curry** - Authentic curry with traditional paste-making techniques3. For any question, it:

14. **Osso Buco** - Italian braised veal shanks from Milan with rich marrow flavors   - Embeds your question

15. **Moroccan Tagine** - North African slow-cooked stew with complex spice blends   - Finds relevant context via similarity search

   - Passes that context + question to a local LLM (`llama3.2`)

---4. Returns a natural-language answer grounded in your data.

## 💬 Sample Queries and Expected Responses

If it's the first time, it will:

### Query 1: Cultural Food Exploration

**Input:** `"Tell me about Polish traditional foods"`  * Create `foods.json` if missing

**Expected Response:** Detailed information about Borscht, Pierogies, Golumpki, and their cultural significance in Polish family traditions and holiday celebrations.* Generate embeddings for all food items

* Load them into ChromaDB

### Query 2: Healthy Food Options* Run a few example questions

**Input:** `"What are some healthy breakfast options?"`

## 🧠 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

---

1. **Data** is loaded from `foods.json`

## 📸 Screenshots - Successful RAG System Operation2. Each entry is embedded using Ollama's `mxbai-embed-large`

3. Embeddings are stored in ChromaDB

### Database Loading Success4. When you ask a question:

```

✅ All documents already in ChromaDB.   * The question is embedded

🧠 RAG is ready. Ask a question (type 'exit' to quit):   * The top 1–2 most relevant chunks are retrieved

```   * The context + question is passed to `llama3.2`

   * The model answers using that info only

### Sample Query Response - Paella Information

```---

You: what is paella 

## 🔍 Try Custom Questions

🧠 Retrieving relevant information to reason through your question...

You can update `rag_run.py` to include your own questions like:

🔹 Source 1 (ID: 86):

    "Paella is Spain's most famous rice dish, originating from the Valencia region, ```python

    where it was traditionally cooked over an open fire in a wide, shallow pan print(rag_query("What is tandoori chicken?"))

    called a paellera..."print(rag_query("Which foods are spicy and vegetarian?"))

```

🤖: Paella is Spain's most famous rice dish, originating from the Valencia region, 

traditionally cooked over an open fire and combining various ingredients such as ---

chicken, rabbit, green beans, lima beans, tomatoes, saffron, and Bomba rice.

### Enhanced Error Handling Display

The system now gracefully handles:
- Empty queries with helpful prompts: `"Please ask a question."`
- Network connectivity issues with clear error messages
- Malformed embedding responses with recovery attempts
- Keyboard interrupts (Ctrl+C) with polite exit: `"👋 Goodbye!"`

## 🧠 Personal Reflection on RAG Learning Experience

Working with Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems has been an enlightening journey that perfectly demonstrates the power of combining traditional information retrieval with modern language models. This project has provided me with hands-on experience in several critical areas of AI engineering.

The most fascinating aspect of RAG implementation was understanding how semantic search works in practice. Watching the system retrieve relevant food information based on user queries, even when the exact words weren't present in the database, showed me the true power of embedding-based search. For example, when users ask about "healthy options," the system intelligently retrieves superfoods and nutritious dishes without requiring exact keyword matches.

The technical challenges were equally educational. Implementing proper error handling taught me about the fragility of distributed systems - when Ollama's embedding service occasionally returns empty responses, the entire system could crash. Building robust exception handling not only improved user experience but also highlighted the importance of defensive programming in AI applications.

Data curation proved to be more important than I initially realized. Simply having more data isn't enough; the quality, structure, and richness of information directly impacts the RAG system's usefulness. Creating detailed food entries with cultural context, nutritional information, and preparation methods made the responses significantly more valuable and engaging.

The cultural aspect of this project was particularly meaningful. Adding Polish traditional foods allowed me to contribute personal heritage knowledge while learning about the importance of cultural representation in AI systems. It reinforced how AI systems reflect the diversity of their training data and the responsibility we have as developers to ensure inclusive representation.

This experience has solidified my understanding that effective RAG systems require careful attention to data quality, robust system architecture, and thoughtful user experience design. The combination of technical skills and domain knowledge creates truly valuable AI applications that can educate and inspire users about the rich diversity of global cuisine.
